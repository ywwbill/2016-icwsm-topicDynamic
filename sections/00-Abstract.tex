There is relation between news and tweets regarding to certain event. We want to detect what news and tweets cover along with evolvement of topics, thus the topic dynamics. We propose a new topic model Single Topic LDA (\stlda) to discover topics of news and tweets under a unified frame. The model supposes that each tweet has only one topic while news are constituted by multiple topics. The method performs better than LDA in accurately detecting topics in tweets. Using the results by \stlda we compare topic dynamics of tweets in and out of \stlouis area, which show difference in geography. Meanwhile we find that there is not much overlapping between topics of news and tweets, mainly because they are using different frames. More diversity exists in tweets, while news covers certain topics with relatively stable trend.
