Looking at the interactions between news content and social media content can help us to understand the increasingly complex dynamics of the relationship between the media and the public surrounding noteworthy news events. Although topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are a valuable tool, they are a poor fit for analyses in which some documents, like news articles, tend to incorporate multiple topics, while others, like tweets, tend to be focused on just one. In this paper, we propose a new model, Single Topic LDA (\stlda), which jointly models news-type documents as distributions of topics and tweets as having a single topic; the model improves topic discovery in news and tweets within a unified topic space by removing noisy topics that conventional LDA tends to assign to tweets in a mixed collection of documents. Using \stlda, we focus on the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown on August 9, 2014, looking in particular at the topic dynamics of tweets in and out of \stlouis area, and at differences and relationships between topic coverage in news and tweets.
